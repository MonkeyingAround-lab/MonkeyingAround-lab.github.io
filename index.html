                <p>Errant Albatros Knights have been known to base themselves here, likely as a staging point should they be needed within the system.</p>

                <p>Due to its extremely comfortable habitable nature, Zhipaye is the center of human colonial occupation of the system and originally the reason for Union's interest in the system.</p>
                <p>Following recolonisation of the system Zhipaye acts as an argicultural export world, sending shipments of crops to trade for resources necessary in expanding its colonies.</p>

                <h1>The Totec System</h1>
                <p>A Single Starred Solar system on the far reaches of the orion arm, the Totec system was first colonised by Karrakin barons several centuries ago. Karrakin occupation of the system extracted many resources of the planets for tithe to throne Karrakis or construction of colonies within the system. </p>
                <p>However, while their exploitation of the system proved fruitful, Karrakin occupation of the Totec system would quickly come to an end. As Baronic Wars tithed larger and larger populations from the colonies of the system many of the worlds were left once again uninhabited by humans and its many space stations were left derelict.</p>
                <p>Following abandonment of the system by Karrakis, it was left uninhabited for close to a century, causing many signs of human occupation to fade away. Recently the system gained Union's attention as a viable system for expansion and inclusion into Union's list of core worlds, this caused a resurgence of colonisation efforts from both idependant colonists and the Smith Shimano Corporation who had taken an interest in the system's potential for nurturing xenobiology.</p>
                <p>Union's efforts in the system have mostly stopped due to a shifting of interests back at Cradle and SSC lobbying to postpone the construction of the Blinkgate, however human life has once again found its foothold in the Totec system with many colonial operations underway as its inhabitants try their best to live life in this star system.</p>
                <p>.</p>
                <p>Colonists within the Totec system enjoy what can be considered a semi-diasporan lifestyle; while they don't enjoy the luxury of post-scarcity life seen on core worlds, they are not facing a constant struggle to survice and scrounge for resources</p>
                <p>Most colonists either work for SSC, IPSN or for their local colony, working as a functional society with varying degrees of sucess for each colony.</p>
                <p>Trade within the system is frequent, with many trader vessels jumping over from nearby solar systems and refueling or bartering for goods at Wander station, this presence of traders is accompanied by a fair share of pirates as well, however most colonists have little to fear from spacebound pirates.</p>
                <p>.</p>
                <p>SSC has been carrying out research on life and phenomena within the system, conducting their operations from a planetary superstructure built around the ocean planet of Mendel-1.</p>
                <p>Researchers from SSC have been bidding on and ordering shipments of Metavault and Blinkspace artifacts in bulk as of late, though many traders see this as an opportuinty for a quick profit, others have grown wary of the Megacorp's intentions within the system.</p>
                <p>.</p>
                <p>Karrakin nobles have been sighted making bases again in the system for the first time since abandoning it, stating they seek to "reclaim" the wealth left behind by their ancestors. </p>
                <p>While these baronic forces have not made any explicit moves yet many colonists are worried that their homes may soon put at risk.</p>
